# McGill Physics Hackathon 2021 - Meteorite Plotting Project

This project was originally created by a team for McGill's 2021 Physics Hackathon and later ported onto github.

The goal of the project was to create a interactive sphere with NASA meteorite data plotted onto it.
Each individual dot on the sphere represents an individual meteorite landing at that corresponding longitude/latitude on the globe. 

The landing data itself was extracted from a csv file containing geolocation data provided by NASA found online. The page where this data was downloaded can be found here: https://data.nasa.gov/widgets/gh4g-9sfh
